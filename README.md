## Business Case: Telecom Churn Analysis & Retention
ABC Telecoms is facing a significant decline in revenue and market share due to increasing customer churn. To address this challenge, I propose a comprehensive churn analysis and retention strategy. By leveraging data-driven insights, we will accurately predict customer churn, identify at-risk customers, and implement targeted retention efforts to minimize customer attrition and maximize profitability.

## Problem Statement
ABC Telecom is experiencing substantial financial losses and operational challenges as a result of high customer churn. The inability to effectively predict and address customer churn is exacerbating this problem. This business case aims to develop a robust framework to mitigate the negative impacts of customer attrition.

## Proposed Solution
1. Collect relevant customer data from various sources, including billing records, usage patterns, demographic information, and customer satisfaction surveys.
2. Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring data quality and accuracy.
3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations, gaining valuable insights into customer behavior and churn drivers.
4. Build a Predictive Churn Model: Develop a machine learning model using appropriate algorithms (e.g.,linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, decision tree) to predict customer churn probability. Select the model with the highest accuracy, such as 80%.
5. Perform Batch Prediction: Apply the trained model to new customers to assess their churn risk and proactively implement retention strategies.
6. Create a Power BI Dashboard: Visualize key performance metrics to track churn rates, customer lifetime value, and the effectiveness of retention efforts.
7. Recommendations.

- There are two options (Spark or Pandas), Choose "Spark". A code is automatically generated to read the raw json file as a Pyspark DataFrame.


## Data Cleaning Preprocessing And Explorative Data Analysis
### Data Cleaning.
- Import necessary python libraries
- Read the csv file
- Fetch the shape of the data (numbers of rows and columns) and check if each column has the right data type and convert columns with wrong data type tothe right data type
- Fetch the summary statistics of each numerical column as well as number of churners against total number of customers.
- Fetch number of missing values from the dataset. Delete records with missing values because they are so small in size compare to the number ofrecords in the dataset, thus there impact is expected to be infinitesimal.
- Group the <tenure column> in to bins

### Explorative Data Analysis
- Perform Univariates Analysis of each of the 'Features' in respect to the 'Label'[churn]
- Convert [churn] into binary values
- Convert all non-numerical variables into dummy variables by applying One-Hot Encoding
- Perform Bivariates Analysis of the 'Features' in respect to the 'Label' [churn]
-  Analyse and draw business insights.
-  Write/Save 'One-Hot Encoded' data into created Lakehouse


## Machine Learning models
Using the saved 'One_Hot Encoding' dataset, the below ML model were developed with their performance metrics as follows
